# Entry & Exit Criteria

## Overview

This document describes the automated entry and exit criteria used by the pair trading monitor.

---

## 📥 Entry Criteria

### Constants

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `DEFAULT_ENTRY_THRESHOLD` | 2.5 | Z-score required for entry signal (raised from 2.0) |
| `MIN_ENTRY_THRESHOLD` | 2.5 | Safety floor - never enter below this Z-score (raised from 2.0) |
| `MIN_CORRELATION_30D` | 0.6 | Minimum 30-day correlation |
| `MAX_CONCURRENT_TRADES` | 5 | Maximum simultaneous positions (env var) |

### Entry Conditions (ALL must pass)

| # | Condition | Check | Timeframe | Reason |
|---|-----------|-------|-----------|--------|
| 1 | **Z-Score Signal** | `\|Z\| >= entryThreshold` | 30d | Spread is diverged enough |
| 2 | **Correlation** | `correlation >= 0.6` | 30d | Assets still move together |
| 3 | **Cointegration** | `isCointegrated = true` | 90d | Long-term structural relationship |
| 4 | **Half-Life** | `halfLife <= 30 days` | 30d | Reversion is fast enough |
| 5 | **7d Confirmation** | `\|Z_7d\| >= threshold × 0.8` AND same direction | 7d | Recent momentum confirms signal |
| 6 | **Hurst Exponent** | `H < 0.5` | 60d | Pair is mean-reverting, not trending |
| 7 | **No Asset Overlap** | Neither asset in existing trade | - | Avoid correlated positions |
| 8 | **Under Max Trades** | `activeTrades < MAX_CONCURRENT_TRADES` | - | Risk management |

### Direction Logic

```javascript
direction = zScore < 0 ? 'long' : 'short'
```

| Z-Score | Direction | Action |
|---------|-----------|--------|
| Negative (< 0) | Long | Asset1 undervalued → Long Asset1, Short Asset2 |
| Positive (> 0) | Short | Asset1 overvalued → Short Asset1, Long Asset2 |

### Position Sizing (Beta-Weighted)

```javascript
weight1 = 1 / (1 + |beta|)
weight2 = |beta| / (1 + |beta|)
```

Example: If beta = 1.5
- Asset1 weight: 40%
- Asset2 weight: 60%

## 📤 Exit Criteria

### Constants

| Parameter | Value | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| `EXIT_THRESHOLD` | 0.5 | Target Z-score for mean reversion |
| `PARTIAL_EXIT_1_PNL` | 3.0% | PnL threshold for partial take-profit |
| `PARTIAL_EXIT_1_SIZE` | 50% | Size of partial exit |
| `FINAL_EXIT_PNL` | 5.0% | PnL threshold for final take-profit (after partial) |
| `FINAL_EXIT_ZSCORE` | 0.5 | Z-score for final exit (after partial) |
| `STOP_LOSS_MULTIPLIER` | 1.2 | 20% beyond maxHistoricalZ |
| `STOP_LOSS_ENTRY_MULTIPLIER` | 1.5 | 50% beyond entryZ |
| `STOP_LOSS_FLOOR` | 3.0 | Minimum stop-loss threshold |
| `HALFLIFE_MULTIPLIER` | 2 | Time stop = halfLife × 2 |
| `CORRELATION_BREAKDOWN` | 0.4 | Exit if correlation drops below |
| `HURST_EXIT_THRESHOLD` | 0.55 | Exit if Hurst indicates trending regime |

### Exit Conditions (checked in order)

| Priority | Condition | Trigger | Action | Emoji |
|----------|-----------|---------|--------|-------|
| 1 | **Partial Take-Profit** | PnL ≥ +3% AND no partial taken | Close 50% of position | 💰 |
| 2 | **Final Take-Profit** | PnL ≥ +5% AND partial taken | Close remaining position | 🎯 |
| 3 | **Mean Reversion Target** | \|Z\| ≤ 0.5 | Full exit | 🎯 |
| 4 | **Dynamic Stop-Loss** | Z > dynamicStopLoss | Full exit | 🛑 |
| 5 | **Time Stop** | daysInTrade > halfLife × 2 | Full exit | ⏰ |
| 6 | **Correlation Breakdown** | correlation < 0.4 | Full exit | 💔 |
| 7 | **Hurst Regime Exit** | Hurst ≥ 0.55 | Full exit | 📈 |

### Dynamic Stop-Loss Formula

```javascript
dynamicStopLoss = MAX(
    entryZ × 1.5,           // 50% beyond entry Z
    maxHistoricalZ × 1.2,   // 20% beyond historical max
    3.0                     // Minimum floor
)
```

Example: Entry at Z = 2.0, maxHistoricalZ = 2.5
- Option 1: 2.0 × 1.5 = 3.0
- Option 2: 2.5 × 1.2 = 3.0
- Option 3: 3.0
- Stop-loss = 3.0

## 📝 Notes

### Why These Thresholds?

1. **Entry Z = 2.0**: ~2 standard deviations, statistically significant divergence
2. **Exit Z = 0.5**: Close enough to mean, captures most of the move
3. **Correlation 0.6**: Strong enough relationship for hedging
4. **Half-life 30d**: Trade should resolve within reasonable timeframe
5. **Hurst < 0.5**: Mathematical confirmation of mean-reversion

### Future Considerations

Currently tracked but NOT used for automatic exit:
- **Beta drift**: Displayed as warning, no auto-exit (threshold TBD: 50%?)
- **Half-life drift**: Displayed, no auto-exit (threshold TBD: 4×?)

These metrics are monitored and displayed to support manual intervention decisions.

### Hurst Regime Exit (NEW - January 2026)

**Rationale**: Analysis of 62 closed trades showed that trades exiting with Hurst > 0.5 (trending regime) had significantly worse outcomes. The mean-reversion strategy fundamentally relies on H < 0.5. When Hurst rises above 0.55 during a trade, it indicates the spread has shifted from mean-reverting to trending behavior, violating the strategy's core assumption.

**Threshold**: 0.55 (slightly above 0.5 to avoid noisy exits)
