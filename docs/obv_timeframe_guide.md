# OBV Timeframe Guide

## How Often to Look at OBV

OBV is cumulative, so the timeframe you use depends on your trading strategy:

### **For Pair Trading (Mean Reversion):**

**Recommended: 30-90 days**
- **30-day OBV:** Short-term momentum, entry/exit signals
- **60-90 day OBV:** Medium-term trend confirmation
- **Why:** Pair trades typically last days to weeks, so you need recent momentum

**What to look for:**
- OBV divergence from price (price down but OBV up = bullish)
- OBV trend change (accumulation → distribution or vice versa)
- OBV vs Z-score alignment (both pointing same direction = stronger signal)

### **For Different Trading Styles:**

**Day Trading:**
- **1-7 day OBV:** Intraday momentum
- Look for OBV spikes on high volume days
- OBV reversals can signal short-term direction changes

**Swing Trading:**
- **30-60 day OBV:** Weekly momentum
- OBV trend confirms price trend
- Divergences signal potential reversals

**Position Trading:**
- **90-180 day OBV:** Monthly/quarterly trends
- Major accumulation/distribution phases
- Long-term trend confirmation

### **For Your HYPE/ZEC Analysis:**

**Current setup (30/90/180 days):**
- ✅ **30-day OBV:** Good for entry timing
- ✅ **90-day OBV:** Confirms medium-term trend
- ⚠️ **180-day OBV:** May be too long for pair trading

**Better approach:**
- Use **30-day rolling OBV** (always last 30 days)
- Compare OBV change rate (how fast it's accumulating/distributing)
- Look for OBV divergence from price

### **Key Metrics to Track:**

1. **OBV Change Rate:** How fast OBV is changing
   - Fast accumulation = strong buying
   - Fast distribution = strong selling

2. **OBV Divergence:** OBV vs Price
   - Price down, OBV up = Bullish (accumulation on dips)
   - Price up, OBV down = Bearish (distribution on rallies)

3. **OBV Trend:** Direction over time
   - Rising OBV = Accumulation
   - Falling OBV = Distribution

### **Practical Recommendation:**

For pair trading with HYPE/ZEC:
- **Primary:** 30-day rolling OBV (updated daily)
- **Confirmation:** 90-day OBV trend
- **Signal:** OBV change rate + divergence from price

**Example:**
- Z-score says HYPE is undervalued (negative Z-score)
- 30-day OBV shows HYPE distributing (negative OBV)
- This is a **divergence** - price is down but volume suggests selling
- Wait for OBV to turn positive (accumulation) before entering

### **When to Recalculate:**

- **Daily:** For active pair trades
- **Weekly:** For monitoring positions
- **Monthly:** For strategy review

The key is consistency - use the same timeframe for comparison.
